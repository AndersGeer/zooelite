City Rail Station Placement Finder
---------------------
-Radius search for things at the edge of the map will fail...it will not add all valid tiles within a rectangle, if it is near the edge it will just fail.
-Location chosen based on cost to flatten. Should instead be chosen on factors including proximity/mergeablity with close cities, proximity to actual city
-Bus stops still need to be attached and connected to city
-Searching occurs in a radius around city, but buildable rectanges are searched from top-left to bottom-right, meaning the algorithm will always favor placements SE of a city
-The algorithm searches rectangles, not actually the footprint of what we need to build, although this might be a speed tradeoff...
-While the figure itself is correct, it might be nice to move it on the plot to change where the bus stations go
